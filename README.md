    This project is an iteration of <a href="https://github.com/nem0z/wiki-pathfinder ">wiki-pathfinder<a>
    The goal is to produce an application capable of crawling, storing and indexing data to build a pathfinder throw wikipedia articles.
    To achive this, this project will use advanced tools like MQRabbit and Neo4j in the opposite of wiki-pathfinder where I will try to scale using internal tools.
